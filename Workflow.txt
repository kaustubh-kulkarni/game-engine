GIT and JIRA workflow
#####################

********************
1. JIRA workflow
********************

In JIRA I have created a project called Game Engine. This project is the has 1 epic that we will be referring to at this moment

EPIC - Game Engine (GE-1)

We will then assign the stories based on the work we are doing but the epic that I have created would be the parent element for the stories

The story convention would be the story name for example GE-2, GE-3 and so on

The person who will be working on the story is the assignee.

So in general it goes something like this EPIC -> STORY

********************
2. GIT workflow
********************

In git we have two branches, one is GEMain which would be the main branch and will be untouched.

The second branch would be GEGate, this is the branch where we push our changes from our respective branches.

An exmaple for this would be, suppose I am working on GE-15 and my work is done. Now I want to open a PR for review. What I would do is following

PR -> GE-15 - GEGate (We will review this together)

Once everything is reviewed and the PR is merged with GEGate, We will then merge it with GEMain.
